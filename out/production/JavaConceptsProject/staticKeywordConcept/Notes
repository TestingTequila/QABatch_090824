Static Keyword:

1. If the value of a variable remains common/same for all the objects of the class, we should prefer making it as static
2. Static variables/methods are stored not in Heap/stack memory
3. Static variables/methods are stored in CMA[common memory allocation], also known as permanent generation or metaspace
4. Only those variables or methods which are part of object can be called using object reference
5. Static variables or methods should be called directly by class name and object reference calling should be strictly avoided.



If its non-static---> Create object and call
If its static    ---> Call directly through class Name[to which static variable or method belongs]
