1. In case global variable name is same as parameters name, we will use this keyword to differentiate b/w them
   'this' keyword will always call the global variable
2. Method Chaining - where 'this' keyword is used to return the object of the same class
3. this keyword can be used to call one constructor inside other constructor. Also, constructor calling has to be the first
   statement inside other constructor
   Constructors can be called within constructors only and not inside the method.
4. To call one method inside of other method [either directly or through 'this' keyword]
