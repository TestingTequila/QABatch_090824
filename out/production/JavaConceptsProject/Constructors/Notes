Constructor is SIMILAR TO METHOD - name is same as class name, no return type including void
Constructor is called automatically the moment instance(object) of class is created
Its used to initialize the object of a class [assign default value to global variables of the class]

Rules for creating a constructor
-Constructor name must be the same as its class name
-A Constructor must have no explicit return type

use of this keyword:
1. To differentiate between global variable and parameters with the same name.
   We use this keyword to call global/class variables

   CONSTRUCTOR:
   For assigning value to the global variables. If you have not created your own constructor(parametrized constructor), default constructor
   will assign default values and if you have created your own constructor, your values will be assigned to global variable
   -Constructor is called automatically the moment you create object of the class.

   If you make constructor as private, you cannot create object of that class
