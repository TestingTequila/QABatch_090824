//final methods cannot be overridden or if you don't wish a method to be overridden ---make it final
//Class can be final too but this class cannot be inherited anymore, this means this final class can never be a parent class ever
   // final --- to store a constant value
   // final --- to stop method overriding
   // final --- to stop a class to be inherited

// static method can be inherited in a child class but cannot be overridden - method hiding concept
// a method can be both final and static but its useless as only one keyword will do the job of not
   allowing the method to be overridden.

// we override an overloaded method
// overload an overridden method
// We cannot override an overloaded static method - in simple way...static methods cannot be overridden.
// Can we overload an overridden static method - We cannot override a static method...so further overloading is not possible
// can we override from grand parents - Yes
