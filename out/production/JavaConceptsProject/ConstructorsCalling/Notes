1- If Parent-Child relationship exists, the child class constructor will call the parent class constructor before
   calling its own constructor

2- In a P-C relationship, child constructor(whether default/parametrized) will ALWAYS call parent class DEFAULT constructor only
3- In a P-C relationship, parent class must have default Constructor even if other constructors exists in parent class
4- We cannot have constructor for an interface and if this interface has any global/class variable, it will have its default value assigned
   while being created by virtue of its final property and doesn't need constructor for initializing the class variable
5- We can have constructor for an abstract class and even though we cannot create object of an abstract class, why because if abstract class
   has some variable, this needs to be initialized as by default, abstract class variables are not final in nature and therefore they are dependent on
   abstract class constructor for initializing.
