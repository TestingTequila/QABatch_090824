What a class consists of...?

1. Variables
2. Methods

MAKE TEA:
Tea leaves
Sugar powder
Water
Milk powder

Methods: Are action/s performed over the variables of the class

Syntax of method:

AccessModifier[public/private/protected] returnType[void/dataTypes] methodName(can/t parameters)
{
   Action over class variables
}


public void makeTea()
{
    Tea leaves+Sugar powder+Water+Milk powder
}

Difference:
1. Wish to share the variable - make it class/global variable
2. If you don't want to share it - make it parameter

Similarity:
You can assign different values to variables and parameters and hence with different values
methods will give different result.

==================RETURN TYPE========================================================
1. If you are using anything apart from void in place of return type in a method, ensure to use 'return' keyword at the
   end of your method code within {};
2. Void and return keyword cannot co-exist

-If you know or feel the result of a method will be used for further calculations/manipulations -assign it a return type
 so that you can store its value and can use it for further calculations/manipulations.
